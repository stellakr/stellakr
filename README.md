## About Me
I have lived in many different countries and enjoy travelling. I have a black and tan dachshund who loves to sleep **a lot**.

I'm from the United States but I live abroad. My favourite color is blue.
[I really want to visit Jamaica.](https://www.sandals.com/blog/content/images/2019/07/9_SMB_11_BEACHLIFESTYLE_08753-2-2.jpg)
I have ~~two~~ one sibling.
I have lived in *six* countries and 4 continents:
1. North America
2. Africa
3. Asia
4. Europe


A small talent I have is I can sometimes read peoples lips[^1].

[^1]: I usually can only do it on people I know.
